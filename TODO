# TODO

- Command-line `dotnet test` fails sporadically (even habitually?)
  - It is always the `SQLServer*` tests that fail.
  - Maybe my Docker instance is slowed down sporadically?
- `SourceWebApplicationTests` deletes all data stored by `SourceWebApplication`.
  This data should however not be important so it might be okay.
