# TODO

- Command-line `dotnet test` fails sporadically (even habitually?)
  - It is always the `SQLServer*` tests that fail.
  - Maybe my Docker instance is slowed down sporadically?
- `SourceWebApplicationTests` deletes all data stored by `SourceWebApplication`.
  This data should however not be important so it might be okay.
- Explain somewhere that an *entity* is not a code object. It is the actual thing being modelled.
  The `Entity` object represents *a specific version* of the entity and it will not change that.
  When events are published, the entity's version is incremented, but the `Entity` remains as it was.
